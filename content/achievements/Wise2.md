I gained hands-on experience building responsive UIs with React, leveraging modern hooks
and state management for dynamic user interfaces. I applied UX principles to design
intuitive user flows and enhance usability.

Additionally, I explored functional programming
concepts through Elixir and Haskell, strengthening my problem-solving skills.
